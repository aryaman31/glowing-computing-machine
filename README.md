# glowing-computing-machine

Our second year DRP (Desigining for Real People) project, Used to streamline the GP appointment process. Takes bookings online and allows receptionists to schedule appointments with ease. 

# Tech Stuff
## Our Stack
We wanted the app to be scalable and realistic. hence we used Java with Spring boot for our back end. We had a postgresql database and a react front-end. Our Java app served the rest api as well as communicated with the database. We hosted everything on heroku. 

## Agile Development
We attempted to stick to using agile practices as much as we could. We used github actions to streamline the testing and building of our app, with auto deployment to heroku from master to make it easy to see changes on prod.

# DRP practices
Our app went through multiple different prototypes. We would make plans, interview potential users and ammend our plans. We repeated this process about 10 times over the course of 4 weeks to get our final product.
