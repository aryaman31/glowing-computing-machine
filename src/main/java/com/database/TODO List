Implement Getters for records x
Implement main loop
Implement business logic based on records
Implement Server inc. Authentication
All sorts of error checking
    - Failure to find collection
    - Failure to find record
    - Failure to create database
    - Non unique _ids (Probably enforce this at some server level)
    - IDs could be nhs numbers - unique to every individual registered to the nhs in the UK
    - Probably an invasion of privacy to use this as an ID for GPs so a different identifier should be used, with a GP prefix


Mandatory rescheduling by receptionists (Need to implement a different type of user)
